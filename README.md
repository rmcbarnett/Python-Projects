# Python-Projects
This repository showcases all the different python projects I've built 

I"m a formeer C# developer with over 10 years experience in coding for windows and web applications. 
Since 2020, Ive been fortunate to be coding exclusivley in Python. Ive decided to take my learning deeper with python and enusre Im doing things in a Pythonic way :) 
Som projects will be very basic as oopposed to what I do for the day job, but hey findamentals are important, right?
