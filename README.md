# Python-Projects
This repository showcases all the different python projects I've built 

I"m a former C# developer with over 10 years experience in coding for windows and web applications. 
Since 2020, Ive been fortunate to be coding exclusivley in Python. Ive decided to take my learning deeper with python and ensure I'm doing things in a Pythonic way :)
The goal is to build 100 projects in 100 days...
Some projects will be very basic as opposed to what I do for programming for the day job, but hey, fundamentals are important, right?
